Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim
=============================================
Persistent Volume (PV) - It’s a piece of network storage that has been provisioned by the administrator. It’s a resource in the cluster which is independent of any individual pod that uses the PV.

Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) - The storage requested by Kubernetes for its pods is known as PVC. The user does not need to know the underlying provisioning. The claims must be created in the same namespace where the pod is created.


1. Creating Persistent Volume
	Use the below yml file to create PVolume
kind: PersistentVolume ---------> 1
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
   name: pv0001 
   labels:
      type: local
spec:
   capacity: 
      storage: 10Gi 
   accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce 
      hostPath:
         path: "/home/ec2-user/efs" 


You can verify above one by , "kubectl get pv"

2. Creating Persistent Volume Claim
	Now you can claim above created volume "pv0001" with below yml 

kind: PersistentVolumeClaim 
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
   name: myclaim-1 
spec:
   accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce 
   resources:
      requests:
         storage: 8Gi   


3. Using PV and PVC with POD


apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: redis
spec:
  containers:
  - name: redis
    image: redis
    volumeMounts:
    - name: redis-storage
      mountPath: /data/redis
  volumes:
  - name: redis-storage
    persistentVolumeClaim:
    claimName: myclaim-1
